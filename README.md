# Planning

- Before I could start this project I first needed to get the planned layout, The fields I required, and Database Schema

## Planned Design

- First, how did I want the site to look where did I want what, and what placement on smaller screens using wireframe I created my layout

### Large Screen Layout

## Deployment

This section describes how to create a new repository.

- This repository was created using [GitHub](https://github.com/) The steps are as followed:
  - I went to the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template)
  - I selected the green button labeled 'Use this template'
  - Then, Create a new repository.
  - Then I was brought to a new page to set the name and setting for my new repository.
  - I named my repository 'R.P.S.L.S'

This section describes how I set up my workspace, Once my repository has been created.

- The workspace I used for this project was [codeanywhere](https://app.codeanywhere.com/). The steps are as follows:
  - I opened [GitHub](https://github.com/) and went to the 'R.P.S.L.S' repository
  - To get the link for codeanywhere I clicked the green button '<>code'.
  - Here under local, I could copy the link needed: <https://github.com/JAmcevoy/R.P.S.L.S.git>
  - Then I went to code anywhere.
  - In workplaces, I selected new workspaces
  - Here I copied the link from the git hub and clicked to create to make my workspace.

This section describes the commands I used in code anywhere to push my code and changes to GitHub.

    -  I created the files and folders needed for my project.
      - index.html
      - assets folder
        - css folder
          - style.css
        - icon folder
        - js folder
          - script.js
        - images
      - Docs
        - images
    - I used the git add . command to add all changes above.
    - Using the git commit command I committed the change and used -m to attach a message to the commit.
    - When I was finished with the creation I used git push to push all these files and folders to GitHub.
    - I used these same 3 commands through the creation and modification

This section should describe the process I went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform.

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits

- I used these resources to research and develop my understanding of JavaScript, as well as get inspiration for my own code. During this research, I have borrowed some ideas and modified the code to suit my project. No code was used unedited

### Design

- All the design screenshots from above came from [Wirframe](https://wireframe.cc/)
